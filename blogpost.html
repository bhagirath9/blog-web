        <p class="font1">Do you have a handful of blogs that you follow purely for fun?

            Over the past few years, I’ve moved away from following primarily recipe blogs to spending my time enjoying
            other types of lifestyle blogs, and it has been awesome. I have blog categories on Feedly for photographers
            I admire, cool people working for social justice, interesting perspectives on faith, DIY stuff I actually
            want to try, you name it! Mostly they’re just blogs that have nothing to do with recipes, and I find that I
            look forward to reading them more than ever. But that said, the blogs in my reader that get the most clicks
            by a landslide are in my favorite category that I have oh-so-creatively named — get ready for it — “fun”.

            <br>
            And they are just that — blogs I find fun! Some I have followed for years and years, some are pretty new to
            me. Some deal with 100% light and fluffy stuff, some dig a little deeper into the meat of life. Some of them
            share the most beautiful prose, some are random and chatty and full of incomplete sentences. But I love them
            all, and can genuinely say that I look forward to reading them most mornings (after I read The Skimm, of
            course, which I’m still obsessed with), and also genuinely admire each of the bloggers behind them. ♥
            <br>

            So if any of you are on the prowl for some new non-recipe blogs, I thought I’d share 7 of my favorites with
            you today. I’m guessing you’ll be familiar with a few, but I’m hoping there might be a few new gems in there
            for you to discover. And hey — if you have some favorites of your own, pretty please share them in the
            comments below, because I totally want to check ’em out.

            Have “fun”!

            What It Is: A lifestyle blog by Erin Loechner, filled with beautifully-written essays on everything from
            design to parenting, marriage, work, travel and more.

            Why I Love It: I’ve never met Erin before in person, but she feels like such a kindred spirit. I have
            enjoyed tuning into her blog for years (like, so many years now!) for a dose of real-life inspiration and
            lovely prose. Her posts on navigating motherhood and marriage have always been some of my favorites. But I
            have always especially connected with her posts on slowing down, creativity, and self-care, probably because
            they’re always words I need to take to heart myself. I really admire how open she has been to letting her
            career evolve and pivot in some big ways over the past decade, and I can’t wait to follow along wherever the
            next roads may lead.

            Recommendations: Every single post in her Life archives. All of the
